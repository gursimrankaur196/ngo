# Adhiyagya
Adhiyagya is an NGO working towards the empowerment of underprivileged children in India through Education. The NGO focuses on Education for All. It works as a parallel support system helping under privileged children gain education that is denied to them. It also aims at helping the children who are enrolled into schools however due to our poor systems do not get the quality of education that they deserve.

<br>This is a web based app designed Using Node.js and Angular.js
<br>The main motive of developing this app was to reduce the redundant paperwork done every day in the NGO.
<br>This app automates the tasks such as
 <br><br>1) Taking attendance of students and volunteers.
 <br><br>2) Generating reports of the performances of students in different tests.
 <br><br>3) It will allow volunteers to upload the question papers of different tests that could be reused by some other centre, or volunteer.
 <br><br>At the initial stage, it is limited to Adhiyagya. 
 Making it generic is a future prospect, we will be working through.
